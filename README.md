# Simple Weather App
This project was written with Vue, to help users find out what is the weather in different parts of the world. It is a continuation of my previous weather app written in vanilla JS, and an exploration into the Vue framework.

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/timlong1994/weather_app_v2.git
   cd weather_app_v2/weather_app
   ```

2. Install the npm packages

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Run the app

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

## Using the App

1. Type in the location for which you wish to find out the weather and press 'Enter'
2. If the location result is not what you had in mind, try again with more specific details i.e. Exact country and city name
